           i go by @dnfny on pretty much all social media sites. i'm twenty two and i've just graduated from the university of miami with my degree in computer science and minors in film, interactive media, and journalism. i'm currently local to the philly area working as a video editor for the webseries Underground and actively seeking full time employment opportunities. Another current project of mine is this website which I've built using just html, css, and javascript hosted through github so if anything seems a little wonky its probably under construction.

         <h3>undergrad</h3>
         <div class="">
           <p>I studied at the university of miami for my undergrad education. I graduate May 14th, 2021 with my ba in computer science with minors in motion pictures, interactive media, and journalism. in 2017 i graduated from highschool and moved to miami alone and began as a marine science computer science double major. after four years and a good bit of trial and error, i found the right fit for me. I chose to drop my marine major and instead got my scuba certification. With the new found space in my schedule i pursued my passion for media and content creation through my minors. through my film minor i found my workstudy job, joined delta kappa alpha, and university of miami television which have all given so much to my college experience. there's always more to learn but i feel i've gained a well rounded understanding of computer science and digital media that will serve me well.</p>

         <h3>abroad</h3>
         <p>insert slider of images from abroad</p>
         <p>in spring of 2019 i spent the semester taking screenwriting, directing, international journalism, 3d animation, and italian cinema. my semester abroad taught me so much about how many different ways there are for me to express myself creatively and that many of them easily work in conjunction with my coding background. once that clicked it opened up a whole new realm of creative possibilities.</p>
